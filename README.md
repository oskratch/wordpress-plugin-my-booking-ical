A WordPress plugin designed for property owners who manage apartments on external platforms like Booking.com and Airbnb, enabling direct reservation requests through their website while synchronizing availability calendars via iCal URLs.

## Overview

This plugin bridges the gap between external booking platforms and your WordPress website by:
- Synchronizing availability from Booking.com and Airbnb calendars
- Allowing visitors to submit reservation requests directly on your site
- Providing administrators with tools to manage and review requests
- Supporting flexible pricing strategies with special date ranges

## Key Features

### Apartment Management
- Create individual booking forms for each apartment
- Connect to multiple iCal feeds (Booking.com, Airbnb)
- Set apartment-specific configurations:
  - Minimum stay requirements
  - Maximum guest capacity
  - Parking availability
  - Base pricing

### Dynamic Pricing
- Define general pricing for each apartment
- Add unlimited special price ranges (seasonal rates, holidays, etc.)
- Automatic price calculation based on date selection

### Availability Synchronization
- Real-time calendar sync from external platforms
- Display only available dates to users
- One-way synchronization (read-only from external sources)

### Request Management
- Collect detailed booking requests with guest information
- Generate unique reference numbers for each request
- Admin dashboard to view and manage all requests
- Manual validation workflow (no automated bookings)

## How It Works

### 1. Setup Phase
Configure apartments in the WordPress admin panel:
- **Basic Info**: Name, reference code
- **Calendar Integration**: Add iCal URLs from Booking.com/Airbnb
- **Settings**: Minimum days, capacity, parking, base price
- **Special Pricing**: Define date ranges with custom rates

### 2. User Experience
Visitors interact with your booking forms:
- Select check-in and check-out dates from available calendar
- View calculated pricing based on selected dates
- Submit request with contact details and preferences
- Receive confirmation with unique reference number

### 3. Admin Management
Property owners review and process requests:
- View all requests organized by apartment
- Access complete booking details and guest information
- Validate requests manually (phone call, email verification)
- Update external platform calendars as needed
